                                        <li> This doesn’t happen as frequently because the mortgage crisis saw a lot of people who ended up in mortgages that they couldn’t pay for because they didn’t have a down payment to prove their ability to pay over time. </li>
                                        <li> there are some instances where you can get a lower down payment, but you rarely will find a loan without one.</li>

                                        <li> Some people get emotional with pricing and want to sell for a lot more than their home is worth, so it's important to have the property valued and listed by an unbiased third party—which is where you come in</li>

                                        <li> It’s important to encourage this for your homeowners, but more important for you to use this particular answer to explain all the perks of having a home inspection.</li>
                                        <li>just a few hundred dollars, in most cases, people can get a detailed look at the house they want to buy and know exactly what they’re getting into</li>
                                        <li> It isn’t necessarily required, but it’s certainly a great way to get peace of mind, even for those who spend upwards of $1,000 on an inspection.</li>

                                        <li>  This is your chance to explain exactly what is included in the closing costs, as well as how much people can expect to spend here. </li>
                                        <li> Although it’s different for each sale, you can usually estimate or suggest a percentage of the sale that will go toward closing costs to help people get a better estimate. </li>
                                        <li> Again, this is more about being transparent than actually providing a definite answer to the question at hand.</li>
